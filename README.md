First Odin Project
I've completed the HTML section on The Odin Project, where I learned about various image types(JPG.PNG.SVG,GIF) and how to properly include them in web pages. I also covered creating links using anchor tags, including external(absolute) and internal (relative)links. Additionally, I explored different HTML elements used to structure content, gaining a solid foundation in the building blocks of web pages. This project will test me on all these knowledge.
