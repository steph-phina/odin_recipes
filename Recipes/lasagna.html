<h2><strong>Classic Lasagna Recipe</strong></h2>
<p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made with layers of pasta, 
rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. This hearty dish is perfect for family dinners,
 gatherings, or when you simply crave comfort food.</p>

    <p>Our version of lasagna features ground beef and Italian sausage 
        in a savory tomato-based sauce, layered with tender lasagna noodles, ricotta cheese, 
        and plenty of mozzarella. It’s baked to perfection until the top is golden brown and bubbling.
         Serve it with a side of garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>
